## Summary of Findings

1. Correlation Between Session Duration and Total Orders

  - The correlation coefficient between session duration and total orders is 0.453.

  - This moderate positive correlation suggests that longer session durations are associated with a higher number of orders, but other factors may also influence order counts.

2. Orders by Session Time of Day

  - Peak Hours:

    - 7:00 PM (5 orders)

    - 6:00 PM (3 orders)

  - Moderate Activity: Afternoon sessions (12:00 PM, 1:00 PM).

  - Minimal Activity: Morning sessions (7:00 AM, 8:00 AM).

  - This suggests that evening time slots are the most popular for sessions and should be the focus for maximizing engagement and order volume.

3. Popular Dishes

  - Top Dishes: Grilled Chicken (4 orders), Spaghetti (4 orders), Caesar Salad (3 orders).

  - Low-Activity Dishes: Pancakes, Veggie Burger, Oatmeal.

  - The presence of "No Session/Orders" indicates missing or unlinked data points, which should be addressed for improved accuracy.

4. Demographics and Order Patterns

  - Age Group Analysis

    - Majority of orders: 25-30 age group (38.9%).

    - Equal contribution: 30-35 and 35-40 age groups (22.2% each).

    - Least contribution: 40-45 age group (16.7%).

    - Younger audiences (25-30) are the most active demographic, suggesting targeted marketing strategies for this group could enhance engagement.

5. Orders by Location

  - Locations with the highest number of orders:

    - Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York: 3 orders each.

    - San Francisco and Seattle: 2 orders each.

  - Lower activity locations: Austin, Boston, Dallas, Miami, Phoenix (1 order each).

  - Major cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York are key markets for driving orders.

6. Favorite Meals

  - Meal Preferences (by order count):

    - Dinner: 8 orders (most popular).

    - Lunch: 6 orders.

    - Breakfast: 4 orders (least popular).

  - Dinner is the prime opportunity for engagement and promotions.

## Recommendations

1. Enhance Evening Slot Engagement

Focus promotional campaigns and special offers during peak hours (6:00 PM - 7:00 PM) to capitalize on higher activity levels.

Introduce limited-time evening deals to further boost orders.

2. Menu Optimization

Highlight and promote the most popular dishes (Grilled Chicken, Spaghetti, Caesar Salad) in marketing materials and on the menu.

Consider reviewing and improving less popular dishes (Pancakes, Veggie Burger, Oatmeal) or replacing them with options that cater to the most active demographicâ€™s preferences.

3. Target Younger Demographics

Design marketing campaigns and loyalty programs specifically for the 25-30 age group, as they contribute the most to orders.

Use social media platforms and influencers popular among younger audiences to drive awareness and participation.

4. Leverage Key Locations

Prioritize marketing and operational efforts in major cities with the highest order counts (Chicago, Los Angeles, New York).

Explore opportunities to increase engagement in moderately active locations (San Francisco, Seattle) and grow presence in cities with lower activity.

5. Focus on Dinner Promotions

Since dinner is the most popular meal, tailor campaigns around dinner specials and family meal deals.

Highlight dinner promotions prominently in advertisements.

6. Address Data Quality Issues

Maintain consistent and complete data recording to improve future insights.
